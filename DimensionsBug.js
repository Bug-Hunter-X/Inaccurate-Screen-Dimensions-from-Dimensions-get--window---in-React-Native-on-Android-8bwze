This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android.  The issue arises because `Dimensions.get('window')` might return incorrect values, especially after orientation changes or during the initial app render.  This can lead to layout issues, elements being clipped or misplaced, and generally a broken user experience. The problem stems from the fact that `Dimensions` doesn't always immediately update to reflect the changes.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage leading to potential errors
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
```
